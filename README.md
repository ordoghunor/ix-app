# Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of cloud deployment methodologies. This was achieved by developing a Spring Boot REST API for customer management. The solution offers intuitive data access, comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, and log aggregation with the ELK stack, providing in-depth insights into system performance.

## Technologies Used

## Deployment

The deployment process has been optimized for both Azure and AWS environments. Deployment onto Azure is facilitated through Azure Container Instances, while AWS deployment is achieved via an EC2 instance. Terraform is utilized for infrastructure provisioning, ensuring flexibility and scalability, while a tailored Ansible playbook streamlines the deployment process.
